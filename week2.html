  <p>Learning to use the CNC Router is a relatively straightforward process, far easier than website building, but still requiring a good amount of instruction. I'm going to skip over the process of designing my organizer in Fusion 3D and ADobe Illustrator, since it will be covered in the next section, and focus on how to properly operate the machine itself.</p>
  <p>Before we can turn the Shaper on however, we need to make sure the work are a is properly prepared. Make sure the cutout you are placing your material into is clean of any debris, to make sure it goes in flat. After that, take your material, in this case, a 8.5inx11.5x0.75in piece of birch wood, and apply the double sided tape to the back. The press it down firmly into the cutout before further securing it with screws in opposite corners.</p>

  <p>After securing the material, we can prepare to cut using the Shaper. Starting by flicking the switch on the power strip to turn everything on, on the Shaper's screen select the "scan" option, and proceed to move the machine so it's camera can get a full scan of the work environment and especially the dotted tape that allows it to identify its position. After that, you can import your SVG file from Adobe Illustrator, and line it up on your wood. Make sure it isn't too close to the screws!</p>

  <p>After importing your file, you can begin to cut. But before that, make sure that the vacuum is attached to the nozzle on the shapper and turned on, and the mill on the shaper is also switched to on.</p>

  <p>Finally, before you start cutting, you can adjust the settings on the left. These control the cut depth, type, diameter, etc. Pictured below are the menus for changing the depth of the cut, and thedifferent types of cuts the shaper can preform. To select a cut type, you must align the reticle on the line you wish to cut. The last step before you cut is to do a z-touch. This tells the shaper how far below the bit the material is. Always do this after picking the shaper up.</p>

  <img src="CNCsettingtype.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>Finally, we are actually beginning to cut! Position the drill above the line you wish to cut, then press the green button to begin cutting. You can either move the reticle along line and the bit will automatically compensate for your movements and cut as you move, or you can hold the green button on the right grip, and it will automatically cut along the line within the target circle.</p>

  <img src="CNCcutting2.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>With the cutting underway, the only thing left to learn is how to change the bits on the mill. Start by turning off the mill and vacuum as you would whenever you stop cutting. Then remove the vacuum hose from the nozzle, unplug the mill from the main body of the machine, loosen the bolt on the right side of the shaper, and pull the mill assembly out. Once out, depress the grey button with one thumb, and use your other hand and a wrench to loosen the bolt around the bit, untill you can remove the bit by hand. Then replace the bit with the new one and do the same steps in reverse.</p>

  <p>And that's everything you need to know about using the CNC Router! It's quite a fun tool to learn and use, though it definetly takes a toll on your back!</p>
