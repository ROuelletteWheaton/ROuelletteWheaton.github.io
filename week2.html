<!--Using the CNC Router-->

  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Using the CNC Router</h3>
  <p>Learning to use the CNC Router is a relatively straightforward process, far easier than website building, but still requiring a good amount of instruction. I'm going to skip over the process of designing my organizer in Fusion 3D and ADobe Illustrator, since it will be covered in the next section, and focus on how to properly operate the machine itself.</p>
  <p>Before we can turn the Shaper on however, we need to make sure the work are a is properly prepared. Make sure the cutout you are placing your material into is clean of any debris, to make sure it goes in flat. After that, take your material, in this case, a 8.5inx11.5x0.75in piece of birch wood, and apply the double sided tape to the back. The press it down firmly into the cutout before further securing it with screws in opposite corners.</p>

  <img src="CNCworkstation3.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>After securing the material, we can prepare to cut using the Shaper. Starting by flicking the switch on the power strip to turn everything on, on the Shaper's screen select the "scan" option, and proceed to move the machine so it's camera can get a full scan of the work environment and especially the dotted tape that allows it to identify its position. After that, you can import your SVG file from Adobe Illustrator, and line it up on your wood. Make sure it isn't too close to the screws!</p>
  <img src="CNCimport.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>After importing your file, you can begin to cut. But before that, make sure that the vacuum is attached to the nozzle on the shapper and turned on, and the mill on the shaper is also switched to on.</p>

  <img src="CNCswitch.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>Finally, before you start cutting, you can adjust the settings on the left. These control the cut depth, type, diameter, etc. Pictured below are the menus for changing the depth of the cut, and thedifferent types of cuts the shaper can preform. To select a cut type, you must align the reticle on the line you wish to cut. The last step before you cut is to do a z-touch. This tells the shaper how far below the bit the material is. Always do this after picking the shaper up.</p>

  <img src="CNCsettingtype.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>Finally, we are actually beginning to cut! Position the drill above the line you wish to cut, then press the green button to begin cutting. You can either move the reticle along line and the bit will automatically compensate for your movements and cut as you move, or you can hold the green button on the right grip, and it will automatically cut along the line within the target circle.</p>

  <img src="CNCcutting2.jpg" style="width:75%">
  <p>With the cutting underway, the only thing left to learn is how to change the bits on the mill. Start by turning off the mill and vacuum as you would whenever you stop cutting. Then remove the vacuum hose from the nozzle, unplug the mill from the main body of the machine, loosen the bolt on the right side of the shaper, and pull the mill assembly out. Once out, depress the grey button with one thumb, and use your other hand and a wrench to loosen the bolt around the bit, untill you can remove the bit by hand. Then replace the bit with the new one and do the same steps in reverse.</p>

  <p>And that's everything you need to know about using the CNC Router! It's quite a fun tool to learn and use, though it definetly takes a toll on your back!</p>

<!--Making my Organizer-->
<div class="w3-container w3-padding-32" id="Documentation">
  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Making my Organizer</h3>
  <p>Designing my desk organizer was a fairly easy and enjoyable process. For the items to go in it, I chose a pencil sharpener, a pen, a 3D-printed miniature figurine, as well as a pocket for general items. I started off in Fusion 360, and quickly added the circle we were requried to make, as well as the pockets. Their orientation and size changed somewhat, but remained mostly consistent from start to finish.</p>

  <img src="CNCprogress3.png" style="width:75%">
  <img src="CNCprogress5finalsketch.png" style="width:75%">
  <p>Earlier versions of the sketch included a slot for a pencil, but I removed it after concerns that it might get stuck easily in the tight slot. Proceeding to the next step of building up the sketch in 3D, you can see some slight edits as I went back and made changes based on how it looked and what layout I thought best. After these were all in place, I rendered what the design would look like when it was finished!</p>

  <img src="CNCprogress9.png" style="width:75%">
  <img src="CNCrender3.png" style="width:75%">
  <p>From here, I moved into Adobe Illustrator to add my initials to the design and get it ready for cutting. This involved filling parts of the design in with specific colors that the machine would recognize and interpret as inscructions on what type of cut to preform on said lines.</p>

  <p>Now it was on to cutting! I won't repeat the steps in the cutting process, as they've already been discussed above, but I will include some pictures of the process. Unforutnately, I made an error when performing my cut that I did not notice until it was far too late. After cutting out my pockets, I noticed that the edges were not straight in places, and I wanted to give it a once-over to straighten them out. However, I accidentally selected the "on-line" cut option instead of the "inside-line" option I meant to pick. As a result, all my pockets ended up being wider than intended, but by the time I noticed the error, I had already widened all of my pockets irreversibly. Fortunately, in the end all my items still fit very nicely into the organizer, and the final product is pictured below.</p>
